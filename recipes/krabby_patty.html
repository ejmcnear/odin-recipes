        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim and cut beef into 1-inch pieces, and spread evenly on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Place in the freezer for 15 minutes, along with the blade of a 
                food processor, until beef is firm. Pulse in the food processor until beef is ground and pebbly. Shape into 4 patties, and season with salt, pepper, and 
                MSG.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until barely smoking.  Add patties and reduce heat to medium - cook to desired 
                doneness.</li>
            <li>On the burger buns, assemble the burgers in this order: patty, lettuce, cheese, onion, tomato, ketchup, mustard, pickles, top bun.</li>
